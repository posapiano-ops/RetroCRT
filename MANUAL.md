# Gotchas

## Always Run RetroCRT Setup after RetroPie-Setup or OS Updates!

This could help avoid bricking your RetroPie installation!

## Garbled Colors

You'll need to update /boot/config.txt and set the following to 519 for RetroTink & 0 for all other platforms.

```
dpi_output_format=0
```

becomes

```
dpi_output_format=519
```

# Installation

## Pre-Built Images

I'm not supporting the pre-built image anymore, please use the manual installation method.  It's an outdated OS and base RetroPie, but it's fine to use as a test bed.

## Manual Installation

I'm assuming you're able to SSH in, or have a monitor & keyboard. I typically connect my Pi via Ethernet when I'm first

You can also do the initial configuration with a monitor hooked up to HDMI.

* [Enabling SSH](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/) on the official Raspbian docs.
  * This is best solved by putting your SD card in another machine and creating an empty file called 'ssh' in the boot
* [Wireless Connectivity](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/README.md) is an option, but
* SSH Clients
  * [Windows](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/windows.md)
  * [Linux & macOS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/unix.md)

### Update Raspberry Pi OS

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y dist-upgrade
```

### Update RetroPie

```
cd $HOME/RetroPie-Setup
sudo ./retropie_setup.sh
```

  * Option U "Update"
  * "Yes" to update installed packages
  * Update underlying OS packages
  * Wait for everything to finish
  * DO NOT REBOOT

### Install & Configure RetroCRT

The install/config script is very straight forward and verbose

```
cd &&
git clone https://github.com/xovox/RetroCRT &&
cd RetroCRT &&
./retrocrt_setup.sh
```

### Reboot!

```
sudo reboot
```

You should now be greeted by EmulationStation all ready to go!

# Customizing

## Splash Images

Currently broken!  See [issue #29](https://github.com/xovox/RetroCRT/issues/29) in our issue tracker.

We check for several images to display as a splash before loading our game.  In my example, we're loading mspacman.zip under FBA/FBN.  These are all in descending order of preference.

```
/home/pi/RetroPie/media/fba/images/mspacman-splash.png    <- custom splash image
/home/pi/RetroPie/media/fba/images/mspacman-splash.jpg    <- custom splash image
[preview image from gamelist.xml]
/home/pi/RetroPie/fba/images/default-splash.png     <- platform-wide splash
/home/pi/RetroPie/fba/images/default-splash.jpg     <- platform-wide splash
/home/pi/RetroPie/splashscreens/default-splash.png  <- system-wide splash
/home/pi/RetroPie/splashscreens/default-splash.jpg  <- system-wide splash
```

# How Everything Works

## Setup/Installation/Configuration

This happens in two stages

* retrocrt_setup.sh
  * This prompts the user for information & then generates our configuration file
* RetroCRT.yml
  * This is an Ansible playbook that reads the configuration & applies changes

## Upgrading

Browse to the RetroPie screen in EmulationStation & select RetroCRT where it will prompt you to upgrade..

This is currently *not* inside of RetroPie-Setup!

## Configuration Files

*Some of this info is outdated & will be updated in the next major release*

* /boot/retrocrt/retrocrt.txt
  * This is the configuration file generated by retrocrt_setup.sh
* RetroCRT/retrocrt_resolutions.csv
  * This contains per-game monitor resolution & orientation information
* RetroCRT/retrocrt_timings/
  * This directory contains display resolutions that we dynamically switch to
* /boot/retrocrt/wpa_supplicant.conf(.txt)
  * Define your WiFi configuration & country code, then RetroCRT will enable WiFi for you
  * If the file doesn't exist, re-run RetroCRT configurator with updates

## Scripts

*Some of this info is outdated & will be updated in the next major release*

* /home/pi/scripts/runcommand-onstart.d/
  * files/runcommand-onstart.d/01-splash.sh
    * This displays a splash screen
  * files/runcommand-onstart.d/75-set_screen_resolution.sh
    * This changes the screen resolution, typically to 1920x240
  * files/runcommand-onstart.d/99-retrocrtdebug.sh
    * This logs debug info to /dev/shm

### Changing Screen Resolution

*Some of this info is outdated & will be updated in the next major release*

This happens before loading a game, and after the game exits.

```
RetroCRT/retrocrt_resolutions.csv
RetroCRT/files/runcommand-onend.d/99-set_screen_resolution.sh
RetroCRT/retrocrt_timings/
```

### Generating RetroArch Configuration

We generate a per-game configuration for RetroArch to give it the following:
* Screen horizontal & Vertical resolutions
* Screen orientation
* Any offsets for games that run > 240p

```
RetroCRT/files/runcommand-onstart.d/50-gen_ra_config.sh
```

```
RetroCRT/retrocrt_resolutions.csv
```

# Reporting Issues

GitHub.com has built-in issue tracking, that's probably best.

If you don't want to sign up for GitHub.com, join our [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/RetroPieCRT/) and post questions or issues there.

# Troubleshooting

Most issues can be solved by re-running the installer via the RetroPie menu.  This will apply, or re-apply, all necessary changes.  Simply select 'RetroCRT' from the RetroPie section of EmulationStation.

Possibly more information can be found in [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

## DIY

I'm assuming you're able to SSH in, or have a monitor & keyboard. I typically connect my Pi via Ethernet when I'm first configuring it for ease.

You can also do the initial configuration with a monitor hooked up to HDMI.

* [Enabling SSH](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/) on the official Raspbian docs.
  * This is best solved by putting your SD card in another machine and creating an empty file called 'ssh' in the boot partition.
* [Wireless Connectivity](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/README.md) is an option, but I prefer wired for simplicity.
* SSH Clients
  * [Windows](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/windows.md)
  * [Linux & macOS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/unix.md)

You can cut & paste this into your terminal.

```
cd &&
git clone https://github.com/xovox/RetroCRT &&
cd RetroCRT &&
/bin/bash ./retrocrt_setup.sh
```
# Hardware Compatibility

If you're looking to connect your Raspberry Pi running RetroPie to an old school CRT set.  You're going to need a few things.

# Resources

* Facebook
  * [RetroPie CRT Gamers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/RetroPieCRT/) is a group I started for this very purpose
  * [The CRT Collective](https://www.facebook.com/groups/444560212348840/) is an excellent resource on TV repair, buying, and general knowledge

# Lowest End, Composite (Not Currently Supported)

NOTE: This method isn't yet supported by RetroCRT, but it will be.

You're going to need a cable with a 3.5mm (1/8th in) connector cable on one end and video/sound connectors on the other end.  There are many cables that look exactly the same on the outside, but are wired differently on the inside.

* OS Configuration Required
  * Standard Raspberry Pi distros support it out of the box, with configuration
  * RetroCRT will support this out of the box in the future

* Software That Supports Connection
  * All Raspberry Pi distros

* Hardware Required
  * CRT with composite input
  * [Zune A/V Output Cable](https://www.amazon.com/Zune-Output-Cable-Discontinued-Manufacturer/dp/B000IXLHOM)
  * [Generic Pi AV Cable](https://thepihut.com/products/av-composite-cable-3-5mm-to-3-x-rca-3m)

* Advantages
  * Low cost of entry
  * You can use 480i for menus
  * You can use 240p for games
  * Looks decent on small screens
  * Incredibly common on most CRTs

* Disadvantages
  * Luma (light) and Chroma (color) are both carried on the same signal, so they interfere with each other
  * This is the lowest quality video output you can get on the Pi
  * This is prone to [dot crawl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_crawl)

# Mid-Range, S-Video (Not Currently Supported)

[S-Video](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-Video) is a decent step up from Composite.  You're separating Luma and Chroma which gives you far less interference, and better color depth.

* OS Configuration Required
  * Customized Raspberry Pi OSs with specific timings set for S-Video, as well as setting video output over GPIO

* OS Support
  * [RetroTink Ultimate](http://www.retrotink.com)'s LAKKA image.
  * RetroCRT will support this in the future

* Hardware
  * CRT with S-Video input
  * [RetroTink Ultimate](http://www.retrotink.com) gives you 16,777,216 colors.

* Advantages
  * Better colors than composite
  * Less interference
  * Better clarity than component
  * Fairly common on CRTs

* Disadvantages
  * Not natively supported by a Raspberry Pi
  * Additional hardware is required

# Lower High-Range, Component/YPbPr

[Component video](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_video) actually encompases *many* video formats, but in NA it typically refers to a specific type of video called [YPb/Pr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YPbPr)... sort of the way we call all facial tissue Kleenex.

This format separates the red and blue signals from luma, and derives the green signal based on the red, blue, and luma signals.

* OS Configuration Required
  * Customized Raspberry Pi OS with specific timings set for component, as well as setting video output over GPIO

* OS Support
  * [RetroCRT](https://github.com/xovox/RetroCRT)'s RetroPie image
  * [RetroTink Ultimate](http://www.retrotink.com)'s LAKKA image.

* Hardware Required
  * CRT with Component/YPbPr input
  * [RetroTink Ultimate](http://www.retrotink.com) gives you 16,777,216 colors.

* Advantages
  * Output at 240p
  * Output at 480p, or 720p possible on HDTVs
  * Very high color depth and clarity
  * Fairly common on higher-end CRTs, which are very cheap/free by now
  * Cheap cables

* Disadvantages
  * Requires moderately expensive hardware
  * Stuck at 240p or lower on standard CRTs
  * Fairly pricy hardware is required

# Upper High-Range, RGB

* Software Required
  * Customized Raspberry Pi OS with specific timings set for RGB, as well as setting video output over GPIO

* OS Support
  * [RetroCRT](https://github.com/xovox/RetroCRT)'s RetroPie image

  * RGB monitor (typical VGA)
  * RGB modded CRT TV
  * Professional RGB CRTs, typically used in media creation
  * The affordable Gert/VGA 666 gives you 18-bit (262,144) color.
    * [North America](https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Adapter-Board-Atomic-Market/dp/B075DM4C5V)
    * [Europe](https://uk.pi-supply.com/products/gert-vga-666-hardware-vga-raspberry-pi)
  * The more expensive [RetroTink Ultimate](http://www.retrotink.com) gives you 24-bit (16,777,216) color.
  * The awesome [pi2jamma](http://pi2jamma.info/) for a drop-in solution for RGB arcade cabinets
  * The awesome [pi2jscart](http://pi2jamma.info/) for RGB scart connections

* Advantages
  * Fairly cheap hardware available
  * Incredible color depth, accuracy, and clarity.  At, or near, arcade quality.
  * Inexpensive and open-sourced hardware is required
  * SCART is common in many countries
  * Many CRTs can be modded to accept this signal
  * Not affected by PAL/NTSC/SECAM regions
  * Can be used with a VGA CRT

* Disadvantages
  * CRTs with OEM RGB support can be very expensive in the Americas
  * Full 24-bit color depth requires moderately expensive hardwwre
  * SCART isn't generally available in the Americas
  * Can be difficult to find and modify a CRT
